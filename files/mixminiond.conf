#   This is a configuration file for the mixminion anonymous remailer.  Edit
#   this file, install it in /etc/ (or elsewhere, if you specify a
#   command-line argument for mixminion), and you're ready to go.
#
#   This file format will probably change between now and version 1.0. Watch
#   out.

[Host]

#   Uncomment this line to define a 'secure delete' command to overwrite
#   deleted files.  (This isn't as secure as you think: see the comment in
#   Common.py).
#
#   If you do not specify a value for this option, and we can't find
#   /usr/bin/shred, we fall back on an internal implementation.
#
#   This is the default command: we just zero out files and unlink them.
#   This choice protects against root (on a non-journaling filesystem), but
#   not against an attacker with deep hardware wizardry and resources.
#
#ShredCommand: /usr/bin/shred -uz -n0

#   Uncomment this line if your system uses a different entropy generator.
#   This file must be a character device that produces a truly random
#   bytestream.
#
#EntropySource: /dev/urandom

#   Ordinarily, Mixminion tries very hard to make sure all your file
#   permissions are reasonable.  Sometimes it is too paranoid for its
#   own good.  When this happens, you can either mark certain users
#   ('system', 'dev', and so on) as trusted, or disable file paranoia entirely.
#
#FileParanoia: yes
#TrustedUser: root

[Server]

#    Location of all mixminion keys and file queues.  You don't need to
#    create this directory; mixminion will do it for you.
#
#    Note that mixminion is fairly strict about its directory permissions:
#    its BaseDir below must be mode 700 and owned by whatever uid mixminion
#    runs as, and all directories above the BaseDir must be writeable by
#    nobody except mixminion and root.
#
#    Don't worry though: Mixminion should give you helpful error messages if
#    you get this wrong.
#
#    (This option used to be called 'Homedir'; either spelling will work.)
#
#BaseDir: /var/spool/mixminion
BaseDir: /home/mixminion-server/mixminion-home/

#    By default, all mixminion-related files are stored in subdirectories
#    of 'BaseDir'.  You can override default placement with the options below.
#    All relative paths are resolved with respect to 'BaseDir'.
#
#    Here are the defaults:
#
#KeyDir: ./keys
#WorkDir ./work
#QueueDir: ./work/queues
#PidFile: ./pid
#LogFile: ./log
#StatsFile: ./stats
#
#    Here is an alternative layout:
#
#BaseDir:   /var/lib/mixminion
#KeyDir:    /var/lib/mixminion/keys
#WorkDir:   /var/lib/mixminion/work
#QueueDir:  /var/spool/mixminion
#PidFile:   /var/run/mixminion/mixminion.pid
#LogFile:   /var/log/mixminion/log
#StatsFile: /var/log/mixminion/stats

#    Minimum severity of messages to include in log file.  Allowable values
#    are: 'NEVER', 'FATAL', 'ERROR', 'WARN', 'INFO', 'DEBUG', and 'TRACE'.
#    If you don't define this, it will default to 'WARN'.
#
#    Warning! If you use 'DEBUG' or 'TRACE', the log will contain messages
#    that could compromise anonymity.  Because mixminion is in alpha stage
#    right now, however, you may well want to log at one of these levels.
#
#LogLevel: DEBUG

#   Change this to 'yes' to make the server echo log messages to stdout.
#
#EchoMessages: no

#   Do we keep track of numbers of packets received and so on?  This is
#   on by default.
#
#LogStats: yes

#   Over how long a time period do we aggregate statistics?  Every time this
#   interval elapses, all current statistics are flushed to a file.
#
#StatsInterval: 1 day

#   How many bits should the server use for its long-lived 'Identity' keys?
#   Must be between 2048 and 4096.
#
IdentityKeyBits: 4096

#   How often should the server rotate its public keys?  If you rotate often,
#   you need less storage space for message hash logs, and messages sent
#   using your old keys are less vulnerable to compromise... but if you rotate
#   too often, your server may drop messages that use out-of-date keys.
#
#   You can't rotate keys more than once a day.
#
PublicKeyLifetime: 1 weeks

#   How long after a key rotation should the old key still work?
#
#   (This should be fairly long, since messages can be delayed in the
#   network when servers go down.  If it's *too* long, however, you
#   enable delaying attacks.)
#
#PublicKeyOverlap: 24 hours

#   Use this option to define a 'nickname' for this server that users will
#   use as a 'friendlier' version of your identity key.
#
Nickname: cryptodotis

#   Use this option to define an administrative contact for the remailer.
#
#   This email address should probably be handled by a _different_
#   computer from the Mixminion server, so that you can get email when
#   the server is down.
#
Contact-Email: sir@sirvaliance.com

#   Use this field for information that users of your remailer may want to
#   have.  Must be no longer than 1024 characters.
#
#   NOTE: Users will not necessarily see this field before they use your
#     remailer.
#
Comments: This is the Mixminion node for The Crypto Project (https://crypto.is). It could be potentially running test server code.

#   Use ONE of these sets of options to configure the pooling algorithm.
#
#   For now, I recommend option one below, even though it's the least secure.
#   It will help us test the system, and distinguish node failure from
#   low volume.  By version 1.0, we'll change the default.
#
#   (1. A Timed mix sends out all messages in the pool every interval.
#       RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING.)
#
MixAlgorithm: Timed
MixInterval: 10 minutes
#
#   (2. A DynamicPool mix always keeps at least 'MixPoolSize' messages in the
#     pool, and never sends out more than 'MixPoolRate' of the messages.)
#
#MixAlgorithm: DynamicPool
#MixInterval: 30 minutes
#MixPoolRate: 50%
#MixPoolMinSize: 5
#
#   (3. A BinomialDynamicPool mix is a randomized version of DynamicPool.
#       When a DynamicPool mix would send P of N messages, a
#       BinomalDynamicPool mix sends each message with probability P/N.)
#
#MixAlgorithm: BinomialDynamicPool
#MixInterval: 30 minutes
#MixPoolRate: 50%
#MixPoolMinSize: 5

#   Longest period of inactivity to wait before shutting down a connection.

[Incoming/MMTP]

#   Use this option to set your IP address.  We'll try to guess, but we might
#   guess wrong, especially if you have multiple network interfaces.
#
#   NOTE: Older (pre-0.0.6) clients will use this value instead of the
#   hostname below, so please be sure it is correct. It will go away in
#   0.0.8.
#
#IP: 0.0.0.0

#   Use this option to set the DNS name that clients will use to look up your
#   IP address.  We'll try to guess, but we might guess wrong.  Newer clients
#   and servers will send you messages based on your hostname, but older ones
#   will still use your IP, so make sure that both fields are correct.
#
#   You can use an IP address here instead, if you are _completely certain_
#   that your server's IP address will never change.
#
#   NOTE: If you can, you should probably make this name point to a separate
#   DNS entry for your mixminion service.  That way, you can move your
#   remailer to a different server in the future without changing this entry
#   and disrupting traffic.

#   Note: No matter how frequent a retry interval you specify, we only retry

#
#   By default, we retry every 60 minutes the first day, and every 7 hours
